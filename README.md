# DeijAlert

A small exploratory project into the [python3 nanoleaf api wrapper](https://pypi.org/project/nanoleafapi/) I put together to better cohabitate with my partner.

The program solves the problem where I come upstairs from my office and have to pass through the back room, (where Deija's office is). The door is out of immediate eyesight, so my sudden appearance will sometimes scare her!

This solutions uses a small program I can run from my machine downstairs to pulsate the light wall for a set amount of time to indicate I am about to come upstairs.



## Installation (assumes basic python programming knowledge)

1. clone this repo
2. install requirements.txt (in virtualenv or system version)
3. invocation:
   - Many ways to do this. I just created a shell alias.
